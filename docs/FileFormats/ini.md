# .ini

Initialization files are commonly-used files for storing things such as settings/configurations. They are text-based and use the `.ini` file extension.

Song metadata for .mid files are stored in a song.ini file. Clone Hero also extends this file to .chart files.

## Basic Structure

### Sections

A song.ini file should be started off with a `[song]`/`[Song]` section header. Leading or trailing line breaks don't matter for CH.

### Tags

Tags are a key-value pair that store each metadata entry.

`<Key> = <Value>`

`Key` is a string, and `Value` is either a string, number, or a boolean, depending on the key. No specific number types are known so far.

The equals sign may, but is not required to be, padded by spaces, but it is recommended as not all games/programs support song.ini files without the padding (Phase Shift, for example).

## Using via ChartTools

WIP (Info such as reading, writing, etc. should go here)

Any tags not modelled by the Metadata class are added to an UnidentifiedData list.

## Available Tags

There are *many* tags in existence, so listing them all in one place is rather difficult. Still, this should be a pretty good amount of them. Additionally, tags can be in any order in the song.ini, so you should *not* rely on the order of tags to determine what is what. There may also be tags out there with inconsistent capitalization.

Typically, a value of -1 is used in number values to specify that the value does not exist (such as setting a difficulty to -1 to display no difficulty number in-game). Other negative numbers should be treated the same unless the tag explicitly supports a negative value.
