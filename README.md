# ChartTools
ChartTools is a .NET 8 library with the purpose of modeling song files for plastic guitar video games like Guitar Hero, Rock Band and Clone Hero. It currently supports reading of .chart and .ini files, with .mid support currently in development.

If you find any bugs, you can report them in the [Issues section](https://github.com/TheBoxyBear/ChartTools/issues) of the repository. Make sure to use the "bug" label.

As this project is in development, it should only be used with charts with a backup available. **I am not responsible for damages to charts!**
